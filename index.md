## Biography

Passionate researcher in computer vision, with a focus on unsupervised learning and out-of-domain generalization. Experienced in developing parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for continual learning and test-time adaptation.

Received an M.S. in Computer Science from Ewha W. University, advised by Prof. Dongbo Min in [CVLab](http://cvl.ewha.ac.kr/). Conducted research on robust adaptation techniques to improve model performance under domain shifts.
Previously worked for 2 years as a Data Scientist at an [AI consulting firm](https://genon.ai/), gaining diverse industry experience across various projects.

Committed to advancing robust adaptation methodologies to enhance model reliability under domain shifts.
